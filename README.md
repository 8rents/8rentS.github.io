This repository provides hosting for `brenton.holiday` on the GitHub pages platform.

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages on the `live` branch.

## Development Roadmap

The goal is to get a website and web develpment workflow set up quickly.

### `v1` - Basic website hosted at [brenton.holiday](https://brenton.holiday)

The first version of the website should consist of just a simple page of links. The page will be hosted at 8rents.github.io.

- **v1.0** - A simple un-themed page with links
- **v1.1** - A crudely styled page
- **v1.2** - A basic node build process. Port and update [Puddletown Bootstrap](https://github.com/PuddletownDesign/puddletown-bootstrap)

### `v2` - Hosted on my own VPS

I will retire the [8rents.github.io](https://8rents.github.io) and begin hosting the site on my own VPS.

## Hosting & Backend Roadmap

Here is the basic outline for how the development of this site will progress.

### Phase `1`

Site will be hosted on GitHub pages with the domain forwarded to `brenton.holiday`.

## Phase `2`

Phase 2 will focus more on backend development and will use either a VPS or Heroku.

## Phase `3`

The final phase will focus on modular builds and quick deployments using `docker-compose` and git and shell script deployments.
