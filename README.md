1. ### [Ephemeral Computing](#)
   How to effectively leave a digital footprint and use a sophisticated toolset without owning a digital device or treating each one in your possession as extremely temporary. Since this is using Github as the main development tool, the `live` branch will be pushed automatically when it's merged from `dev`

1. ### [brenton.holiday](brenton.holiday/)
    __brenton.holiday website__    
    
    The [brenton.holiday](#) website is a host and tutorial for building your own web services. It will handle everything from setting up a VPN to managing an XMPP server.   
    
    This is the code base for the [brenton.holiday](#) website. __Please note: the website is not yet up or registered__. This is just a place holder for it. 
2. ### [CheckEdit](checkedit/)
     CheckEdit is a node project that uses a Todo list to manage your git repository. For example, when you check off a todo item it will automatically create a commit to the repo with the line item as the commit message. When loading the repo, it will check for commits and then build the completed todo log based on existing commits.
