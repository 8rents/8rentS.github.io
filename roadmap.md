## Development Roadmap

The goal is to get a website and web develpment workflow set up quickly.

### `v1` - Basic website hosted at [brenton.holiday](https://brenton.holiday)

The first version of the website should consist of just a simple page of links. The page will be hosted at 8rents.github.io.

- **v1.0** - A simple unthemed page with links
- **v1.1** - A crudely styled page
- **v1.2** - A basic node build process. Port and update [Puddletown Bootstrap](https://github.com/PuddletownDesign/puddletown-bootstrap)

### `v2` - Hosted on my own VPS

I will retire the [8rents.github.io](https://8rents.github.io) and begin hosting the site on my own VPS.

> *Optionally, I can leave the www set to GitHub but begin forwarding other services to the VPS*

### Git Repositories

My personal website and services will be deployed via git and scripts exclusively.

**Several git repositories will be used:**


1. `github` - versioning
2. `github.io` - GitHub hosting
3. `vps` - VPS hosting

## Hosting & Backend Roadmap

Here is the basic outline for how the development of this site will progress.

### Phase `1`

Site will be hosted on GitHub pages with the domain forwarded to `brenton.holiday`.

## Phase `2`

Phase 2 will focus more on backend development and will use either a VPS or Heroku.

## Phase `3`

The final phase will focus on modular builds and quick deployments using `docker-compose` and git and shell script deployments.
